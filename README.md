# GlucoLog
Your personal glucose tracking companion.

Built Using SwiftUI & HealthKit.

Diabetes is deeply personal to me. My grandmother, a diabetic patient, struggles daily to track her glucose levels. She relies on a worn-out notebook to log readings and meals, but managing her health this way is difficult and inefficient. I wanted to change that.
GlucoLog is my answer—a simple yet powerful app that makes diabetes tracking effortless It offers an intuitive UI, easy logging, and reminders for pre/post-meal tracking.
This isn’t just an app; it’s a mission. If GlucoLog can make life easier for my grandmother and others like her, then I’ve made a difference.❤️
