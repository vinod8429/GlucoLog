🏆 *Winner – Apple Swift Student Challenge 2025*  
📍 *Invited to Attend WWDC25 In Person at Apple Park*

**GlucoLog** is a thoughtfully designed **SwiftUI** app that empowers users—especially elderly individuals—to effortlessly log and monitor their blood glucose levels, meals, and medications. Born out of a personal need to support my grandparents in managing diabetes, the app combines simplicity, accessibility, and functionality in a native iOS experience.

> 🥇 **Winner – Swift Student Challenge 2025**, selected by Apple from thousands of global student submissions.  
> 🍏 Earned an **exclusive invitation to WWDC25 at Apple Park**, along with **AirPods Max** and a **1-year Apple Developer Program membership**.  
> *(I was unable to attend WWDC25 in person, but the recognition itself remains one of my proudest milestones.)*
